## **Getting Started**

1) [**Fork and clone**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIR-Margaret/ForkAndClone) this repository (if you haven't already)

2) Create a file called `solutions.js` (this is where you will store your solutions)

3) Read the instructions below

4) Complete the exercise below (at least attempt each problem)

5) Submit your homework (see bottom of markdown)

## **Instructions**

- Try your best to write a template
- Be detail-oriented, and don't leave anything out

## **Tips:**

- If you're stuck on something for "too long" or get overly frustrated, make a comment for yourself and move on. Return to it later. You may find some later problems easier. Sometimes taking a break and coming back later with fresh eyes is all you need.

- **You are not alone!** Everyone else in the class is working on this as well. Send Slack messages, make a Zoom channel, or meet with the TA to discuss sticking points.
