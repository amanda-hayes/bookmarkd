#### Learning Objectives

- React State
- Controlling Input in React
- Rendering Data with React

#### Prerequisites

- React State
- React Props
- Capturing Input

## Requirements
- When the app loads, your app should render a list of items from a array of data. You can use the data below.

```js
  const toDoListData = [
    {
      title: "Learn more about React",
      completed: true
    },
    {
      title: "Write a new Component",
      completed: false
    },
    {
      title: "Add some style",
      completed: false
    }
  ];
```

- If the item is not completed, render the item on the page
- Your app shoould have an input that allows the user to enter a new to do item
- When the user submits the form (presses enter) the value in the input should be added as an item on your to do list.

### Bonuses
- Allow the user to complete an item by clicking on it. When the user clicks on a list item, toggle its completed state to true and no longer display that item. 
- If you get the above bonus completed, try refactoring your app so that the items which are completed remain on the page with a strike through them
- Style your to do list according to the [Working Example](https://2s8g5.csb.app/)
